## GRC - Clearwater Project

The Clearwater project is a governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) initiative focused on streamlining asset inventory management and aligning policy documentation with Brightington Academy (made up) risk thresholds and appetite. It serves to centralize key documents, ensure accountability, and support regulatory compliance efforts through structured tracking and reporting of critical systems and processes.

All documentation related to the Clearwater compliance and asset management initiative is located in the **THIS** folder.
