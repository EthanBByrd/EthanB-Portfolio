# Clearwater Risk Management Project

## Overview

This project simulates a complete enterprise-level **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** workflow using Clearwater’s CC|IRM (Cybersecurity Compliance | Information Risk Management) platform. It was developed to mirror the real-world tasks a cybersecurity risk analyst or GRC professional would perform when managing organizational information security risks.

The project includes identifying sensitive information assets, importing asset data into a centralized risk management platform, grouping assets by shared technical environments, evaluating threats and vulnerabilities, assigning risk levels, and designing appropriate risk response strategies. The work culminates in a set of formal documentation deliverables, similar to what would be required in an audit or executive-level review.

## Objective

To perform a risk assessment and response plan for a simulated organization, applying risk management principles and practices aligned with NIST and industry standards. The end goal is to reduce risks to an acceptable level based on a defined risk threshold and document the findings in a professional format.

---

## Scope

- Asset identification and classification  
- Importing and structuring information assets in Clearwater CC|IRM  
- Creating component groups based on shared infrastructure or system types  
- Setting an organizational risk threshold  
- Performing five detailed risk determination assessments  
- Proposing mitigation strategies for each risk  
- Documenting risk response actions  
- Generating and formatting professional-grade reports

---

## Skills and Concepts Applied

- Risk Analysis & Risk Scoring (Likelihood x Impact)  
- Governance and Accountability Assignment (Data Ownership)  
- Asset Inventory Management  
- Threat & Vulnerability Assessment  
- Control Evaluation and Enhancement  
- Residual Risk Calculation  
- GRC Reporting and Documentation  
- NIST SP 800-30-aligned methodology  

---

## Tools Used

- **Clearwater CC|IRM** – Cloud-based information risk management platform  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Asset data manipulation and report formatting  
- **PDF Export Tools** – For creating deliverable documentation  

---

## Deliverables

- **Asset Inventory Report**  
- **Risk Rating Detail Report**  
- **Risk Response Report**

Each deliverable was formatted and submitted as a professional document ready for audit review or organizational compliance reporting.

## GRC Relevance

This project covers all three domains of GRC:

- **Governance**: Defining risk thresholds, assigning ownership, enforcing policy boundaries  
- **Risk**: Performing structured risk assessments and impact analysis  
- **Compliance**: Generating traceable documentation and audit-ready reports  

This makes the Clearwater RM Project an ideal portfolio piece for roles in cybersecurity governance, risk analysis, compliance auditing, and IT risk consulting.

## Status

**Completed** — All phases, assessments, and documentation submitted and verified.
