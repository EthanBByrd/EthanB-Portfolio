# iPad/iOS

This will be a bit more of a personal blog post and less of just stating what I know about something or informative. At my current job, there are workerss who are out in the field, working on bridges, milling, or some kind of roadway, and the foremans, and superintendents are provided with iPads, to track progress, take picture of work done, and clock their teams hours.

## Cisco Meraki MDM
Before being deployed out into the field, I have to set up the iPads in our MDM which is Cisco Meraki. Cisco has a wide range of uses when it comes to setting up, tracking, and monitoring the iPads.

### Cisco Tools
- Approximate location tracking
- Details (Model, Serial no. Charge, Owner)
- OS
- Security details
- Storage
- Network info
- Cellular info
- Remote commands (Erase, install and uninstall apps)
- Event log
