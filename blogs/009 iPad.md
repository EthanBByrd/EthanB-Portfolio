# iPad/iOS

This will be a bit more of a personal blog post and less of just stating what I know about something or informative. At my current job, there workerss who are out in the field, working on bridges, milling, or some kind of roadway, and the foremans, and superintendents are provided with iPads, to track progress, take picture of work done, and clock their teams hours.

## Cisco Meraki MDM
When it comes to setting up iPads before they are deployed, we will be enrolling them in MDM with Cisco Meraki. This will allow us to track the iPads location if lost or stolen, remotely turn it off, erase it, wipe the passcode, install apps on it, and all sorts of other things.
