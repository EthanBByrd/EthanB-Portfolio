# Zero Trust

If you’ve been in IT or cybersecurity long enough, you’ve likely heard the phrase “Zero Trust” more than once. But Zero Trust isn’t a buzzword — it’s a modern approach to security built for today’s threat landscape.

## What is Zero Trust?

**Zero Trust** is a cybersecurity model that assumes *no* user, device, or application should be trusted by default — even if it’s inside your network perimeter.

> “Never trust, always verify.”

It shifts security away from the outdated perimeter-based model and instead focuses on strict identity verification, continuous authentication, and least-privilege access across the entire IT environment.

## Why Zero Trust Matters

Today’s threats are no longer just external. Insider threats, compromised accounts, and lateral movement inside the network make traditional perimeter-based security ineffective. With remote work, cloud computing, and BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), Zero Trust is becoming a necessity.

### Benefits:
- Reduced attack surface
- Minimized lateral movement
- Improved visibility and control
- Stronger protection against phishing, malware, and insider threats

## Core Principles of Zero Trust

1. **Verify Explicitly**
   - Always authenticate and authorize every access attempt based on user identity, device health, location, and more.

2. **Use Least-Privilege Access**
   - Limit user and system access to only what’s absolutely necessary to reduce risk exposure.

3. **Assume Breach**
   - Design the system as if an attacker is already inside. Monitor, log, and respond to anomalies.

4. **Segment Everything**
   - Use microsegmentation and network isolation to prevent lateral movement and reduce blast radius.

5. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Trust is not a one-time check. Implement real-time monitoring, logging, and response mechanisms.

## Real-World Examples

- MFA is required *every* time you access a resource — not just once a day.
- A compromised laptop with outdated antivirus is blocked from accessing internal systems.
- Users in finance can’t access development servers — even if they’re on the same VPN.

## How to Start Adopting Zero Trust

You don’t have to overhaul your infrastructure overnight. Start here:

- Enforce MFA everywhere.
- Inventory all devices and users.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
- Begin segmenting your network.
- Monitor for unusual behavior.
