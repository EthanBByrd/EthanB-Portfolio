# Phishing Attacks and Reflections

Today I decided to read a bit more into **Phishing attacks** after having posted some TikToks about it and having just recently done a project on it using **GoPhish**.

As you may or may not know, **Phishing** is a type of **social engineering attack**. **Social Engineering attacks** are a type of attack that leverage human interaction along with emotions to manipulate the target. Add a technology stack and you have got yourself a **Phishing attack**. There are multiple types of 
**phishing attacks** and it even goes beyond that to something like **Vishing**.

## Phishing

This is when a malicious actor sends out an email that looks like it is coming from a trusted source (**coworker, family member, SO**) and attempts to get information from you, hold you for ransom, or get you to click a dirty link. There are many things to look out for and to consider when being sent
one of these emails. **Is this their email address?** Instead of `ebyrd@gmail.com` it might be `ebyrd02039@gmail.com`, or something completely random and generated. **Would the president of the company I am working for email me asking me to buy gift cards or send him my Social #'s?** Sometimes the emails will have poor punctuation
or odd spacing in them and seem 'empty'.

## Whale Phishing

This is a **Phishing attack** but is made to target 'big fish' at the company, such as a **CEO, VP, or President**. These head honchos at the company are likely to hold higher permissions or have access to more secure data. It is also known that sometimes higher ups at companies do not care about security 
or are lazy and set weak passcodes, or don't have **2MFA**, or click on dirty links because they fall for the social engineering. If a threat actor sends an email to a **whale** saying they have something on them and are holding them for ransom or they get them to click a link and get ransomware installed, they are more
likely to just pay it since they have the funds to do so. 

## Spear Phishing

This type of **Phishing attack** can be dangerous because the attacker takes their time to study the intended target and sends them a message that pertains to their interests or something they would want. This type of attack will a lot of the time use **email spoofing** making it look like the email is
coming from a different sender. This is usually someone they trust or something they get emails from often or were expecting. These can go as far as **website cloning**, so the victim can't tell they clicked a bad link and are putting in their credentials to a completely fake site and are having their identity stolen.

## Importance of Prevention

Each of these attacks are dangerous in their own right. There are many different ways to stop these kinds of attacks. **All of these start with the IT team.** Onboarding users and teaching them how to safely search the web, how to look for bad emails, and to avoid clicking random links. The IT team can utilize tools 
such as **Mimecast** to block emails that are flagged as potentially dangerous, and teach users to report and delete these emails. As mentioned at the start, **Phishing campaigns sent within the organization** can be crucial tooâ€”people who fail and click links or respond will have to take a class and learn why they 
failed and how to make sure it does not happen again. 

**Repeat offenders** will have:
- **Warnings and documentation**
- **Privilege restrictions (temporarily)**
- **Performance reviews**
- **HR involvement if necessary**

You should not shame anyone publicly or be too over the top with first time offenders. At the same time though, they must understand it is for their own good, and an actual ransom attack can be devastating for companies. Attacks like these could mean **data loss**, which in turn loses time, money, company reputation, and customer trust.

So it is important that **Phishing Campaigns are used** and that **users and employees are taught** what to look out for and what to do if they see it. I have seen first hand what ransom attacks can do to a company and it is not pretty, so as a **Cybersecurity or IT professional**, ensure your users are properly equipped and prepared for these kinds of situations.
