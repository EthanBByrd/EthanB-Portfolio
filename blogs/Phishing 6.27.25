Today I decided to read a bit more into Phishing attacks after having posted some TikToks about it and having just recently done a project on it using GoPhish.

As you may or may not know, Phishing is a type of social engineering attacks. Socail Engineering attacks are a type of attack that leverage human interaction along with emotions to manipulate the target. Add a technology stack and you have got yourself a Phishing attack. There are multiple types of 
phising attacks and it even goes beyond that to something like Vishing.

Phishing: This is when a maliocus actor sends out an email that looks like it is coming from a trusted source (coworker, family memmber, SO) amd attempts to get information from you, hold you for ransom, or get you to click a dirty link. There are many things to look out for and to consider when being sent
one of these emails. Is this their email address? Instead of ebyrd@gmail.com it might be ebyrd02039@gmail.com, or something completely random and generated. Would the president of the company I am working for email me asking me to buy giftcards or send him my Social #'s? Sometimes the emails will have poor punctuation
or odd spacing in them and seem 'empty'.

Whale Phishing: This is a Phishing attack but is made to target 'big fish' at the company, such as a CEO, VP, or President. These head honchos at the company are likely to hold higher permissions or have access to more secure data. It is also known that sometimes higher ups at companies do not care about security 
or are lazy and set weak passcodes, or don't have 2MFA, or click on dirty links b/c they fall for the social engineering. If a threat actor sends an email to a whale saying they have something on them and are holding them for ransom or they get them to click a link and get ransomware installed, they are more
likely to just pay it since they have the funds to do so. 

Spear Phising: This type of Phishing attack can be dangerous b/c the attacker takes their time to study the intended target and sends them a message that pertains to their interestes or something they would want. This type of attack will a lot of the time use email spoofing making it look like the email is
coming from a different sender. This is usually someone they trust or something they get emails from often or were expecting. These can go as far as webiste cloning, so the victim can't tell they clicked a bad link and are putting in their credentials to a completely fake site and are having their identity stolen.

Each of these attacks are dangerous in their own right. There many different ways to stop these kinds of attacks. All of these start with the IT team. Onboarding users and teaching them how to safely search the web, how to look for bad emaails, and to avoid clicking random links. The IT team can utilize tools 
such as Mimecast to block emails that are flagged as potentiallty dangerous, and teach users to report and delete these emails. As mentioned at the start, Phishing campaigns sent withen the organization can be crucial too, people who fail and click links or respond, will have to take a class and learn why they 
failed and how to make sure it does not happen again. Repeat offenders will have warnings and documentation, privelege restrictions (temporarily), performance reviews and even HR involvement if neccesary. You should not shame anyone publicly, and be to over the top with first time offenders. At the same time 
though, they must understand it is for their own good, and a actual ransom attack can be devesating for companies. Attacks like these could be mean data loss, which in turn loses, time, money, company reputation, and customer trust. So it is important that Phishing Campaigns are used and that users and employees
are taught what to look out for and what to do if they see it. I have seen first hand what ransom attacks can do to a company and it is not pretty, so as an Cybersecurity or IT professional, ensure your users are properly equipped and prepared for these kind of situations.
