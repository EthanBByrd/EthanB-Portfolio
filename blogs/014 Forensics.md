# Computer Forensics

## Overview
Computer Forensics, also known as Digital Forensics, is the practice of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence in a way that is legally admissible. It plays a critical role in modern investigations involving cybercrime, fraud, data breaches, and civil disputes.  

This field blends computer science, law enforcement procedures, and legal principles to ensure evidence is collected and handled properly.

## Key Objectives of Computer Forensics
1. **Identification** – Recognizing potential sources of digital evidence.  
2. **Preservation** – Ensuring data is not altered or destroyed.  
3. **Analysis** – Examining evidence using specialized tools and techniques.  
4. **Documentation** – Recording each step of the investigation for transparency.  
5. **Presentation** – Delivering findings clearly for courts, organizations, or investigations.

## Importance in Today’s World
As technology becomes more embedded in everyday life, the potential for digital crime increases. Computer forensics provides investigators with the ability to uncover critical evidence from computers, mobile devices, servers, and cloud environments. Without proper forensic practices, crucial data could be lost, overlooked, or rendered inadmissible in legal proceedings.

## Best Practices
- Always maintain a **chain of custody** for all evidence.  
- Use **write blockers** when imaging drives to prevent altering data.  
- Document every action taken during the investigation.  
- Stay updated with the latest forensic tools and methodologies.
