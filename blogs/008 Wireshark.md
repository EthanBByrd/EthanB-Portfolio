# Wireshark

If you're working in IT, cybersecurity, networking, or simply curious about how data flows across a network, you've probably heard of Wireshark. It's one of the most powerful tools available for analyzing network traffic, best part is that it's completely free and open source.

## What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that captures and displays data packets in real time. It allows you to inspect every detail of network communication happening on a system, giving you a full view of whatâ€™s being sent and received across a network interface.

Think of it as a digital microscope, in that it gives visibility into the lower layers of network communication that are typically hidden behind applications and services.

## What Can You Do With Wireshark?

Wireshark offers a wide range of capabilities, including:

- **Capturing network traffic** from interfaces such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Loopback, and virtual adapters
- **Inspecting protocols** such as TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, TLS, FTP, ARP, and many others
- **Filtering data** by IP address, port, or protocol to narrow down traffic for focused analysis
- **Troubleshooting network issues**, including latency, dropped packets, DNS failures, or handshake problems
- **Reassembling data streams**, such as following a TCP session or reconstructing HTTP requests and responses
- **Detecting anomalies and suspicious behavior**, useful for cybersecurity analysis and incident response

## How Is Wireshark Used Today?

In modern technology environments, Wireshark is widely used across multiple industries and roles:

### Network Engineers and System Administrators
- Diagnose and fix connectivity issues
- Monitor bandwidth usage
- Validate firewall or routing configurations

### Cybersecurity Analysts
- Investigate security incidents
- Monitor for unusual or unauthorized activity
- Analyze malware behavior through traffic inspection

### DevOps and Site Reliability Engineers (SRE)
- Debug application-layer issues
- Validate API calls and service communications
- Ensure proper SSL/TLS handshakes and encryption

### Educators and Students
- Teach how network protocols function in real-world environments
- Provide hands-on experience with live packet captures
