# Information Technology vs Information Security 
When first reading these names you may think they are the same thing with a potentially fancier name. Today I want to break down what each role is and the differences between them, but how at the end of the day they work together.

## Information Technology (IT)
IT is the term used to refer to those work with the use of computers, systems, software, networks, and infrastrcutre to stores, process, retrieve, and transmit any kind of data. The main goal of this role is to support any kind of business operation involving technology, improve productivuty through those tech stacks, and manage digital resources.

### IT Examples
- Setting up and maintaining networks and servers
- Installing and managing software
- Providing technical support
- Managing databases and cloud systems

## Information Security (InfoSec)
InfoSec is a specialized branch of IT focused on protecting information systems from unauthorized access, misuse, disruption, or destruction. WHen it comes to things such as a Disaster plan recovery (DPR) or any kind of data protection, the InfoSec team takes the reigns. Their main
goal is to safeguard data confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)

### InfoSec Examples
- Implementing firewalls and antivirus solutions
