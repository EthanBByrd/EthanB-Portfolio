# Information Technology vs Information Security 
When first reading these names you may think they are the same thing with a potentially fancier name. Today I want to break down what each role is and the differences between them, but how at the end of the day they work together.

## Information Technology (IT)
IT is the term used to refer to those work with the use of computers, systems, software, networks, and infrastrcutre to stores, process, retrieve, and transmit any kind of data. The main goal of this role is to support any kind of business operation involving technology, improve productivuty through those tech stacks, and manage digital resources.

### IT Examples
- Setting up and maintaining networks and servers
- Installing and managing software
- Providing technical support
- Managing databases and cloud systems

## Information Security (InfoSec)
InfoSec is a specialized branch of IT focused on protecting information systems from unauthorized access, misuse, disruption, or destruction. WHen it comes to things such as a Disaster plan recovery (DPR) or any kind of data protection, the InfoSec team takes the reigns. Their main
goal is to safeguard data confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)

### InfoSec Examples
- Implementing firewalls and antivirus solutions
- Conducting risk assessments and audits
- Managing user permissions and authentication
- Responding to security breaches or cyberattacks

## Main Differences

| Aspect                | Information Technology (IT)                     | Information Security (InfoSec)                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Focus**     | Building, maintaining, and supporting systems   | Protecting systems and data from threats                    |
| **Goal**              | Optimize performance and productivity           | Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)  |
| **Scope**             | Broad: includes networks, servers, software     | Narrower: focuses on protection and risk management         |
| **Roles Involved**    | Network admins, system engineers, IT support    | Security analysts, compliance officers, incident responders|
| **Tools Used**        | Virtual machines, routers, databases            | Firewalls, encryption tools, SIEM platforms                 |
| **Risk Management**   | Typically focuses on uptime and efficiency      | Directly focused on identifying and mitigating threats      |

## How They Work Together

While IT and InfoSec serve different functions, they must work hand-in-hand to ensure a secure and efficient technology environment.

- **Shared Infrastructure**: InfoSec depends on the IT team to properly configure and maintain secure systems, networks, and devices.
- **Collaboration on Policies**: IT helps enforce security policies (like access control and software updates) that InfoSec designs and recommends.
- **Incident Response**: When a threat or breach occurs, both teams collaborate to investigate, mitigate damage, restore systems, and prevent future issues.
- **Training and Awareness**: IT often supports InfoSec in rolling out cybersecurity training, updates, and alerts to all users.
- **Security by Design**: When IT builds or integrates new systems, InfoSec ensures that security best practices are followed from the start.

Together, IT and InfoSec create a balanced ecosystem where systems are not only functional and reliable but also secure from evolving cyber threats.
